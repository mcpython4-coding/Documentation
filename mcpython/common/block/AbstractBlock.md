        WARNING:
            - During registration, one block instance is created but NEVER assigned to a world (so on_block_added is never
                called). This is used for getting runtime-specific properties.

        function __init__(self)
            
            Creates new Block-instance.
            Sets up basic stuff and creates the attributes
            Sub-classes may want to override the constructor and super().__init__(...) this
            For modders:
                - setup attributes here
                - fill them with data in on_block_added

            Called when the block is removed
            Not cancelable. Block show data is removed, but the "current" state of the block is still stored.
            After this, the block might stay for some time in memory, but may also get deleted.
            :param reason: the reason of the removal, defaults to BlockRemovalReason.UNKNOWN

                ):
            
            Called when the player pressed on mouse button on the block.
            :param player: the entity instance that interacts. WARNING: may not be an player instance
            :param button: the button pressed
            :param modifiers: the modifiers hold during press
            :param hit_position: where the block was hit at

            API function for chunk serialization
            :return: bytes representing the whole block, not including inventories
            todo: add a saver way of doing this! (pickle is an unsafe interface)


        function load_data(self, data)
            
            Loads block data
            :param data:  the data saved by get_save_data()

        function get_inventories(self)
            
            Called to get an list of inventories
            FOR MODDERS: use get_provided_slot_lists() where possible as it is the more "save" way to interact with the block
            todo: move to capabilities


        function get_provided_slot_lists(self, side: mcpython.util.enums.EnumSide)
            
            Similar to get_inventories, but specifies only slots & the side on which the interaction can happen.
            Useful for e.g. furnaces which can get fuel from the side, but from top the item to smelt.
            gets slots for various reasons for an given side
            :param side: the side asked for
            :return: an tuple of lists of input slots and output slots
            Slots may be in inputs AND output.

            Sets the model state for the block
            :param state: the state to set, as an dict
            WARNING: do NOT raise an error if more data is provided, as sub-classes may want to add own data
