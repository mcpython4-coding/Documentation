            Not cancelable. Block show data is removed, but the "current" state of the block is still stored.
            After this, the block might stay for some time in memory, but may also get deleted.
            :param reason: the reason of the removal, defaults to BlockRemovalReason.UNKNOWN

            Called when the player pressed on mouse button on the block.
            :param player: nullable, the entity instance that interacts. WARNING: may not be a player instance

            Called to get an list of inventories
            FOR MODDERS: use get_provided_slot_lists() where possible as it is the more "save" way to interact with the block
            todo: move to capabilities
