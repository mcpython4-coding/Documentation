What is this file about?

It contains an changelog of what was changed and what should 
be changed in the near future. (which may change in the near future)

If you contribute anything, it should be mentioned in the changelog
following the following style:
"[<you developer name>]: <what you have done>"

Things for future versions should be inserted as the following:
"todo: <what you want to (be) changed>"

Feel free to create issues when you don't want to pull request your 
ideas. We will try to work out if, how and when to implement your 
changes. If you want to implement things by yourself, you needn't add
firstly a todo task, simply create an pull request and we'll see when we
can merge it onto the main branch.

If you are contributing and have not contributed before, you will be 
asked if you want to be mentioned in the credits. In case you accept,
your name will be visible in every file header.

If you want to simply play, feel free to do that. You may want to use
the launcher for getting updates automatically. Feel free to create
issues on the github page on everything you find odd or is not working
as intended. If you are not sure, we will help you finding out.
